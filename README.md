# Hive-libft_gfx
Graphics library addon for libft

See `test.c` for a Wolfenstein-like game, which is the testbed for the graphics functions being implemented for libft_gfx.

## Todo
- Make [libft](https://github.com/Gontjarow/Hive-libft) and [libft_vec](https://github.com/Gontjarow/Hive-libft_vec) submodules for this library instead of repeating code.
